Creating a TO-DO App: Documentation

This documentation outlines the development of a simple TO-DO application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features task management capabilities including adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and toggling task priority.

## Overview

The TO-DO app allows users to:

- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Toggle the priority of tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the app's content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app's interface.
- **JavaScript**: Used for adding interactive functionalities such as task management and local storage integration.

## Implementation

### HTML Structure

The app's HTML structure consists of an input field for adding tasks, a button for submitting tasks, and an unordered list (`<ul>`) where tasks are displayed.

```html
<div id="app">
    <h2>My TO-DO List</h2>
    <input type="text" id="taskInput" placeholder="Add a new task">
    <button onclick="addTask()">Add Task</button>
    <ul id="tasksList"></ul>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling

The app's styling includes basic layout and design choices such as font family, background colors, padding, and interactive states for buttons.

```css
body, html {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 0;
}
/* Additional styles omitted for brevity */
```

### JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used to implement the app's logic, including task management and local storage operations.

- **Adding Tasks**: Users can add tasks through the input field. Each task is stored in local storage, allowing persistence across page reloads.
- **Editing Tasks**: Users can edit the content of a task. This is facilitated through a prompt dialog.
- **Deleting Tasks**: Tasks can be removed from the list and local storage.
- **Marking Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be toggled between completed and pending states.
- **Toggling Priority**: Users can mark tasks as a priority, which is visually indicated (e.g., by changing the background color).

#### Core Functions

- `addTask()`: Adds a new task.
- `editTask(taskId, newContent)`: Edits the content of a task.
- `deleteTask(taskId)`: Removes a task.
- `toggleTask(taskId)`: Toggles the completed state of a task.
- `togglePriority(taskId)`: Toggles the priority state of a task.
- `getTasks()`: Retrieves tasks from local storage.
- `saveTasks(tasks)`: Saves tasks to local storage.
- `loadTasks()`: Loads and displays tasks from local storage.

### Local Storage

Local storage is used to persist tasks between page reloads. Tasks are stored as a JSON string and include properties for ID, content, completion status, and priority.

### Enhancements for Future Development

While the app provides basic task management functionalities, further enhancements could include:

- Implementing categories or tags for tasks.
- Sorting tasks by priority or completion status.
- Adding deadlines to tasks and sorting them accordingly.
- Integrating a calendar view for time-based task management.
- Implementing user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their tasks.

## Conclusion

This TO-DO app demonstrates a practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a functional web application. Through local storage, the app offers persistence, ensuring that user data is retained across sessions. This project can serve as a foundation for more complex task management and productivity applications.
